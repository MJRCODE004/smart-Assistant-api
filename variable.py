# Scenario 1
# assign one variable with one value


age = 20
print(age)

# Scenario 2
# Assign another value with same variable name
# The output gives only the last updates value of the variable , because the code executed in line by line

                  # Example
age = 20
age = 32
print(age) # The output for this variable age is 30


# Scenario 3
# Assign values to variables in different ways

age = 20
price =19.5
first_name = "Monesh"
is_online =  True
print(first_name)

## These are the ways we can assign values with different datatype

# Exercise

# Question
# 1. we check in patient named john smith
# 2. he is 20 years old
# 3. he is a new patient


patient_name = "John Smith"
age = 20
new_patient = True

print(patient_name)
print(age)
print(new_patient)
