# Comparison Operators
# These operators always return the Boolean values

x = 3 > 2  # -- Checks that 3 is greater than 2 if not it will return False
print(x) # True

x = 3==2 # -- checks that 3 is equal to 2 if not it will return False
print(x) # False

x = 3!=2 # -- Checks that 3 is not equal to 2 if yes means it return True if not it return False
print(x)  # True

#  That Comparison operators are :
#
# 1 . >         - Less Than
# 2 . >=        - Less Than Equal to
# 3 . <         - Greater Than
# 4 . <=        - Greater than equal to
# 5 . ==        -  Equal to
# 6 . !=        - Not Equal To
